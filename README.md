# Milestone1 - Profile Page

[Github](https://github.com/Paul-Glanville/milestone1 "Github project page")

## Description

This is a Profile and Portfolio site which contains history of education and work along with a page for displaying recent and previous projects that I create and work on.

I want the user to be able to navigate with ease and simplicity without worry of confusion on which page they are on or be over powered and presented with a mass of information on each page.

## Features

### Heading
1. H1 - This is the title of the page and the biggest heading.
2. H2 - Second biggest heading used and is used for the headings in the sections with the exception of the persons name.
3. H3 - Used as the heading for the timeline section on the about page.
4. H4 - This heading is the lowest heading size used on this page and is used for the bottom of the page to title the Social section.

### Nav

This is the navigation menu which is presented at the top of the page and has been set to remain in place regardless of screen size. The navigation menu consists of the Home page, an About page and a Portfolio page.
 
### Section One
This section has a backgrund image which has a different image across the three main pages but, the profile image remains the same as well as the name and profile titles. the section also has a Bio related to each page and a mini description regarding the background image.

### Section Two - News Feed
The second section on the index.html page it is for the news and updates feed which will have more function at a later time.

### Section three - Timeline, Education and work History
The third section created is on the about.html page and is used for the Education and Work History timeline to present the previous work history and education.

### Footer
The Footer section contains two parts one for the Social class to direct the user to the social media links and the other part is the Contact Us section which when clicking on the link will open another page to allow the user to send an email if they desire.
The icons used for the social links are from font awesome.

## Future updates
add projects onto the portfolio pafe, and update news feed to incorporate regular information and updates including patch updates.

## Testing
I have used W3C Validation service to ensure both the HTML and CSS are without errors and are corrected.
I believe it was some incorrectly used code to implement the content and whether certain aspects should be hidden on a mobile device but that has been rectified and confrmed through the validator that all code is correct.

- Clicking on About, Home and Portfolio will take the user to the associated page.
- Clicking the link for contact us takes the user to a new page to fill out a form to contact via email.

The pages viewed in media screens for tablets and laptops are working as planned, and constant cheking of whether each change in size and placement was right.
The background image and the timeline placements were the hardest to do as the timeline needed to change style and direction as the screens got smaller. 
The background Image however had to be able to adjust to each screen size with as minimal interferance with the overlaying content as possible.
