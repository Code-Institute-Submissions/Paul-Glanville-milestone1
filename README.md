## Description

This is a Profile and Portfolio site which contains history of education and work along with a page for displaying recent and previous projects that I create and work on.

I want the user to be able to navigate with ease and simplicity without worry of confusion on which page they are on or be over powered and presented with a mass of information on each page.

## Testing
I have used W3C Validation service to ensure both the HTML and CSS are without errors and are corrected.
I believe it was some incorrectly used code to implement the content and whether certain aspects should be hidden on a mobile device but that has been rectified and confrmed through the validator that all code is correct.

- Clicking on About, Home and Portfolio will take the user to the associated page.
- Clicking the link for contact us takes the user to a new page to fill out a form to contact via email.
- When submitting originally it wouldn't inform the user that the form hadn't fully be filled out but after moving around some html in the form pagethe alert to inform the user of the space that needs filling out appears.

The pages viewed in media screens for tablets and laptops are working as planned, and constant cheking of whether each change in size and placement was right.
The background image and the timeline placements were the hardest to do as the timeline needed to change style and direction as the screens got smaller. 
The background Image however had to be able to adjust to each screen size with as minimal interferance with the overlaying content as possible.

While testing there was an issue with the footer where it would appear in the middle of the screen instead at the bottom of the page on the portfolio.html and the form.html pages, So after changing different aspects of the footers CSS code i had found it was an issue with the "position" code that had been in place and had found that the issue had started when using absolute and fixed after reverting it back to relative.

There was an issue with the padding on the portfolio.html page which using rem on the "contain" section pushed it past the screen size and removing it would thn fit the content withing the screen and allow adjusting content easier.
